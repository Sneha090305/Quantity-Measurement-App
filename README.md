#  Quantity Measurement Application 

##  Overview

The **Quantity Measurement Application** started as a simple “Feet Measurement Equality” problem and has evolved into a **full-fledged Spring Boot REST API**.

This application supports:

* Comparing quantities
* Adding and subtracting measurements
* Converting units
* Persisting results in a MySQL database

It follows a **clean N-Tier Architecture** and uses **Spring Boot + Spring Data JPA** for enterprise-level backend development.

---

##  Features

*  Compare quantities (e.g., 12 inches = 1 foot)
*  Add & subtract measurements
*  Convert between units
*  Supports multiple measurement types:

    * Length
    * Weight
    * Volume
    * Temperature
*  REST APIs with JSON request/response
*  MySQL database integration
*  Spring Data JPA (no JDBC)
*  Global Exception Handling

---

## ️ Architecture

The project follows **N-Tier Architecture**:

```
Controller → Service → Repository → Database
```

### Layers:

* **Controller** → Handles REST API requests
* **Service** → Business logic
* **Repository** → Data persistence (JPA)
* **Entity** → Database mapping
* **DTO** → Data transfer between layers

##  Tech Stack

* Java 17+
* Spring Boot
* Spring Web
* Spring Data JPA
* MySQL
* Maven
* JUnit (for testing)

##  API Endpoints

### 🔹 1. Add Quantities

**POST** `/quantity/add`

```json
{
  "q1": {
    "value": 1,
    "unit": "FEET",
    "measurementType": "Length"
  },
  "q2": {
    "value": 12,
    "unit": "INCHES",
    "measurementType": "Length"
  }
}
```

✅ Response:

```json
{
  "value": 2.0,
  "unit": "FEET",
  "measurementType": "Length"
}
```

---
